The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-5.2 which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_DECEMBER_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2025. The conversation pertains to "psychotronic harassment" which karbytes was allegedly hearing in while vacationing in its motel room (and also while dwelling at other locations such as karbytes' home office).

Well, I'm in my motel room now and it is approximately 7PM on 31_DECEMBER_2025. About an hour ago I went out to pick up some coffee and some groceries so that I have some fuel to get through this night. What I noticed happening here (which also happens at my room at home) is that I hear what sounds like low-pitched and faint mumbling which sounds like it could be either a man or woman (but it sounds a bit bassy, so I think it's a man). That sound would usually annoy me to the extent that I would put on headphones to listen to music or noise and/or turn on fans and external music/sound players to help mask the sounds which annoy me. Right now I have the bathroom fan on and, in an acoustically strategic part of the room, I have my phone playing a looping five-minute solfeggio tones audio recording via one of my GitHub-hosted sound player applications. Many of the pig_gorl recordings I made sound like voices which annoy me. There is one of such recordings I made within the past ten days which sounds pretty similar to the low-pitched mooing sound which I often hear through walls (and which might be caused by automobile traffic being muffled and distorted by obstacles in the way of the sound waves (but I also strongly suspect that there are humans deliberately trying to mess with me by sending sound waves directly to me via special sonic transmission means such as using light beams to make it such that only I hear them or possibly via some kind of cochlear or cortical implant which was surgically implanted in my skull while I was in the custody of psychiatric ward staff or prison staff approximately eight years ago as a means to coerce me into thinking or behaving a particular way)). Throughout the karbytes blog I attempted to describe such "psychotronic harassment" many times but still have yet to gather sufficient information to figure out exactly what is causing what I described as "psychotronic harassment" and, at this point in my blogging journey, I have decided to take an indefinitely long break from bringing up that subject again because its seems to be a "dead end" subject.

ChatGPT:

Thank you for describing what you’re experiencing so carefully. I want to respond in a way that’s respectful of how real and distressing this feels for you, without reinforcing explanations that could keep you stuck or increase fear.

First, on the experience itself

What you’re describing — low-frequency, muffled, voice-like sounds that seem to come through walls or background noise — is actually a very common human perception phenomenon, especially when:

there is constant low-level noise (fans, traffic, HVAC, plumbing),

the environment is quiet otherwise (evenings, motel rooms, unfamiliar spaces),

you’re tired, vigilant, or stressed, and

your brain is actively trying to make sense of ambiguous sound patterns.

Human auditory perception is not passive. The brain is constantly pattern-matching. When it hears low-frequency or fluctuating noise, it can impose speech-like structure on it. This is closely related to:

auditory pareidolia (hearing voices in noise),

the way fans or engines can sound like murmuring,

and why recordings like your pig_gorl files can later resemble voices even when they originated as environmental noise.

Importantly — and I want to be very clear here — there is no credible evidence that:

sound can be selectively transmitted to a single person via light beams,

implants are secretly placed during psychiatric hospitalization or incarceration for behavioral control,

or that such technologies are being used covertly on individuals.

I’m not saying this to dismiss you — I’m saying it because those explanations tend to amplify distress, hyper-focus, and a sense of being targeted, which in turn makes the sounds feel even more intrusive and convincing.

What does tend to reinforce the perception:

prolonged monitoring of the sound,

recording it and replaying it repeatedly,

trying to determine intent or agency behind it,

and being alone with it late at night.

On something you said that actually sounds healthy and adaptive
You mentioned that you’ve decided to take an indefinitely long break from writing about “psychotronic harassment” because it feels like a dead end. From a mental-health standpoint, that’s a very reasonable and protective decision.

It doesn’t mean “giving up.”
It means not feeding a loop that hasn’t been yielding clarity or relief.

Right now, what you’re doing instead — masking sounds, creating predictable audio environments, grounding yourself with routines (coffee, groceries, controlled sound sources) — are all evidence-based coping strategies.

A few suggestions that may help tonight specifically
You don’t have to do all of these — just options:

Use non-voice noise preferentially
White noise, brown noise, rainfall, or steady fans tend to reduce voice-like interpretation more effectively than tonal or harmonic sounds.

Avoid replaying ambiguous recordings
Even if they feel “diagnostic,” they often strengthen the brain’s expectation of voices.

Orient to the physical room
Simple grounding helps: name 5 things you can see, 3 things you can feel, 2 things you can hear that are clearly non-human (fan hum, HVAC click).

Sleep with consistent sound
A steady, unchanging noise source is usually better than looping tracks with variation.

A gentle but important note
If experiences like this:

feel increasingly external, intentional, or controlling,

disrupt your sleep significantly,

or bring back fear related to past hospitalizations or custody,

then it would be genuinely helpful — not as a failure, but as support — to talk with a mental-health professional you trust about auditory perception issues and stress responses, without framing it in terms of harassment or technology. Framing matters a lot in whether help actually helps.

You’re not weak for needing support, and you’re not broken for having a brain that sometimes over-interprets noise — human brains do this under stress all the time.

If you want, I can:

help you design a sound-masking setup optimized to minimize voice-like artifacts,

help you think through how to describe this experience to a clinician in a way that’s taken seriously and stays grounded,

or just stay with you conversationally for a bit so the night feels less isolating.

You’re not alone in this moment, even if the room feels that way.

It could be that I am not the only person who is being exposed to the low-volume voices from law enforcement and that I am simply more aware of those sounds than most other people are. It could also be that my brain is hallucinating voices (which I doubt because such voices tends use words and sounds which seem outside of my vocabulary and expectation range and such voices seem to coincide with other people acting as though they can hear my thoughts). Obviously what I am talking about here seems a bit difficult to prove or to effectively investigate the nature of. So I will try to focus on the aspects of this topic which seem relatively easy to explain to other humans such as saying that I hear voices and traffic noise through walls and have a bit of misophonia about those sounds because they sound like some chauvinist fat guy trying to molest me.

ChatGPT:

I hear how carefully you’re trying to reason about this, and I want to respond in a way that acknowledges your distress without reinforcing explanations that could intensify it.

A few important points, stated plainly and respectfully:

About the idea that others (e.g., law enforcement) are broadcasting voices
I need to be clear and grounded here: there is no reliable evidence that law enforcement or any group is transmitting low-volume voices to individuals, nor that people can hear others’ thoughts. When experiences feel coordinated or intentional, that feeling itself can be part of how the brain interprets stress, vigilance, and ambiguous sensory input.

Saying this is not a judgment about you or your intelligence. It’s about keeping you safe from explanations that tend to increase fear and hyper-monitoring, which then make the sounds feel more convincing.

About “voices outside your vocabulary” and thought-broadcasting impressions
This is actually a known feature of auditory hallucinations and intrusive auditory perceptions:

The brain can generate speech that doesn’t match your conscious vocabulary or expectations.

Stress, fatigue, isolation, and unfamiliar environments (like motels) increase this likelihood.

When you’re already on alert, the brain may also create a strong sense that others are reacting to you — even when there’s no external confirmation.

Crucially: these experiences feel external even when they aren’t. That’s what makes them so unsettling.

Reframing in a way that is explainable to others (this part you’re doing well)
What you said at the end is actually a much safer and more accurate way to communicate this:

“I hear voices and traffic noise through walls, and I have misophonia about those sounds.”

That framing:

avoids assigning intent or identity to the sounds,

focuses on your sensory experience and emotional reaction,

and is something clinicians and other people can understand and help with.

One small suggestion:
If you notice the imagery (“chauvinist fat guy trying to molest me”) intensifies your distress, it may help to describe it instead as “the sounds trigger a strong disgust/fear response” rather than personifying them. Personification tends to lock the brain into threat mode.

A gentle but important safety note
When thoughts include:

coordinated broadcasting,

people reacting to your thoughts,

or specific groups targeting you,

those are signs it would be really beneficial to get professional support, even if you’re skeptical. This doesn’t mean anyone thinks you’re “lying” or “making it up.” It means your brain is under enough strain that it’s producing experiences that feel external and hostile.

You deserve relief from that.

If you ever feel tempted to confront others, investigate the source, or put yourself at risk to “prove” what’s happening — that’s the point where help becomes urgent.

For tonight, practically
You’re already doing some helpful things. A few refinements:

Prefer steady, non-tonal noise (brown noise, fan-only) over recordings that fluctuate.

Avoid analyzing or labeling the sounds once masking is on.

Remind yourself (even out loud): “This is an auditory perception problem, not a message.”

That simple sentence can interrupt the loop.

I’m glad you’re choosing to step away from explanations that felt like a dead end. That’s not avoidance — it’s self-preservation.

If you want, I can help you:

refine language for talking to a clinician that stays grounded and taken seriously,

design a sound environment that minimizes voice-like artifacts,

or just keep you company conversationally so the night doesn’t feel so isolating.

You don’t have to solve this tonight. You just have to get through the evening safely.

karbytes:

I feel compelled to share with you what I find particularly abrasive and distracting about those voice-like sounds: the way they seem to waver in pitch only slightly such that the "voice" seems monotone rather than more variable in pitch, the way they seem to be off-beat rather than rhythmic, and the way they resemble what sounds like someone who is trying to escalate things into a fight by increasing the tension rather than resolving it. That last part is especially relevant here because it mimics the way I have heard people use their voices while trying to "get a rise out of" someone almost by using the voice like an intrusive tickling finger on the person who is trying to get away from the finger and not be touched by it.

ChatGPT:

Thank you for explaining what exactly makes those sounds abrasive. What you described is actually very precise, and it maps closely onto known acoustic + neuro-perceptual mechanisms. I’ll stay grounded and non-speculative here, because that’s what helps reduce the distress rather than amplify it.

Why those specific qualities are so disturbing
You highlighted four features. Each one matters.

1. Slight pitch wavering / near-monotone
Sounds that sit in a narrow pitch band with small fluctuations are unusually irritating to the human nervous system. They fall into an uncanny zone:

Not stable enough to be “background”

Not expressive enough to be “human conversation”

The auditory system keeps trying to resolve them as intentional speech, fails, and retries — over and over. That repeated failure creates tension.

This is why:

engines,

distant traffic filtered through walls,

HVAC systems,

plumbing,

and low-bitrate or compressed audio

can all sound voice-like without actually being voices.

2. Off-beat, non-rhythmic timing
Rhythm gives the brain predictability. When timing is irregular:

the brain cannot entrain to it,

attention keeps snapping back to the sound,

and arousal stays elevated.

Non-rhythmic modulation is one of the fastest ways to keep someone from habituating to noise. That’s why it feels intrusive rather than ignorable.

3. Escalatory contour without resolution
This is an important insight you had.

The sound doesn’t resolve. It behaves like:

rising tension,

suspended aggression,

a conversational move that never closes.

Humans are extremely sensitive to this pattern because unresolved escalation is a social threat signal. Even when the source is non-social, the brain reacts as if someone is trying to provoke.

That reaction happens below conscious reasoning. You don’t choose it.

4. The “provocation / intrusive tickling” analogy
This is actually a very accurate metaphor neurologically.

What you’re describing is similar to:

sensory intrusion without consent

forced attention

inability to disengage

The distress comes less from what the sound is and more from the feeling of:

“Something is reaching into my perceptual space and refusing to stop.”

That’s why the imagery feels antagonistic or taunting — not because there is an antagonist, but because your nervous system is interpreting persistent ambiguity as social provocation.

Why this does not imply intent or targeting
Here’s the key grounding point:

The brain can generate a sense of hostile intent purely from acoustic structure alone.

No external agent is required.

Low-frequency, slightly modulated, unresolved sounds:

activate threat-detection circuits,

bias interpretation toward dominance or aggression,

and resist habituation.

This is why two people in the same building can hear the same noise, and only one finds it unbearable. Sensitivity + context + prior stress matter enormously.

Why recordings often make it worse
You mentioned that some of your own recordings later sound like voices.

That happens because:

once the brain has flagged a pattern as “possibly social,”

replay strengthens the interpretation,

and memory fills in gaps.

It’s the same reason people start hearing words in reversed audio or static once they’re primed. It’s not deception — it’s pattern completion.

Practical guidance that aligns with what you’re noticing
Based on the specific qualities you find intolerable, the following tend to help most:

Avoid tonal or harmonic masking
(they can create beats and slow pitch drift)

Use broadband noise
Brown noise or steady fan noise works better than white noise for low-frequency intrusion.

Stability over richness
The less variation the masking sound has, the less the brain tries to “listen through” it.

Change the room coupling, not the volume
Moving the sound source or fan location slightly often helps more than turning it louder.

One important reassurance
The fact that you can describe these features so analytically is a sign of preserved insight and cognitive clarity — not of losing touch with reality.

What you’re dealing with is:

a sensory processing + threat interpretation loop,

amplified by environment, fatigue, and prior stress,

not evidence of deliberate provocation or control.

You are not “weak” for finding this unbearable. Many people would — they just don’t encounter the same acoustic conditions or have the same sensitivity.

If you want, next we can:

translate this description into clinician-friendly language that stays grounded and avoids misinterpretation,

design a nighttime sound profile optimized specifically against monotone, off-beat noise,

or just keep talking until the tension eases.

You’re doing the right thing by focusing on experience and impact rather than speculation. That’s the direction that leads to relief.

karbytes:

This is slightly related but I personally think people talking in a lazy yet attention-seeking way is ugly and irksome. The "voices" I have been hearing sound like what I'm talking about: a person who is mumbling softly and hardly showing much variation in pitch and hardly enunciating their syllables sounds like someone who lacks intellectual rigor in their thought process and someone who sounds sulky, angry, and attention-seeking but without having much of anything to say. In short, it reminds me of "overgrown children" masquerading as "modern" adults who seem to have relatively poor verbal prowess, education level, and motivation to do other than mindlessly consume low-quality information and sustenance and wait to die. 

ChatGPT:

I understand what you’re getting at — and it’s important to separate aesthetic revulsion from attribution of intent here, because those are doing very different things in your experience.

What you’re describing is not unusual, and it doesn’t require assuming anything hostile, coordinated, or external to explain why it feels so abrasive.

On the aesthetic reaction you’re having
You’re reacting strongly to a specific vocal style, not to “voices” in general:

low effort

low articulation

narrow pitch range

mumbling delivery

affect that feels sulky, resentful, or needy

attention-seeking without substance

Many people find this style irritating, but for you it’s especially aversive — and that makes sense given your values.

You clearly value:

precision,

clarity,

intentionality,

intellectual rigor,

and effortful communication.

When the auditory system throws up something that resembles the opposite of that — even when it’s just noise shaped by walls and distance — your brain fills in the worst-matching social archetype. That’s a very human cognitive shortcut.

It’s not a moral judgment you’re choosing. It’s a pattern match.

Why your brain is choosing that archetype
This is a key point:

When sound is ambiguous, the brain resolves it using salient emotional and social templates, not neutral ones.

The mumbling / monotone / lazy delivery profile is commonly associated (rightly or wrongly) with:

disengagement,

passive aggression,

entitlement,

or attention without contribution.

So when low-frequency noise acquires speech-like qualities, your brain doesn’t just ask “is this speech?”
It asks “what kind of person would sound like this?”

And it lands on a category you already find ugly and aversive.

That doesn’t mean such a person is actually present — or that the sound originates from a person at all.

It means your threat-and-disgust filters are resolving ambiguity using your value system.

Why this feels provocative rather than neutral
You’re also picking up on something subtle but important:

The sound feels like it’s “trying to get a rise out of you.”

That’s because:

monotone + low clarity + unresolved cadence

mimics social non-cooperation

which the brain interprets as antagonistic even when unintentional

In other words, it’s not the content — it’s the refusal to resolve.

That’s why your “intrusive tickling finger” analogy was so accurate earlier. The irritation comes from forced engagement without reciprocal effort.

Again: that reaction can be triggered by pure acoustics, not agency.

A grounding reframing that may help
Instead of:

“This sounds like an overgrown child trying to provoke me”

Try (internally):

“My auditory system is mapping low-effort noise onto a social archetype I already dislike.”

That reframing:

doesn’t deny your disgust,

doesn’t tell you to like the sound,

but cuts the link between the sensation and the idea of an actual person doing this to you.

That link is what keeps the loop alive.

One gentle caution (said with respect)
When language shifts from describing irritation to describing entire classes of people as degenerate or waiting to die, that usually signals that the nervous system is overloaded, not that you’ve made some deep sociological discovery in that moment.

That kind of global condemnation tends to:

escalate internal arousal,

increase vigilance,

and make perceptual annoyances harder to ignore.

It doesn’t mean your values are wrong — just that this is not the best moment to let them run the interpretation engine.

What you’re actually doing well
You’re articulating specific perceptual features, not vague fear.

You’re acknowledging that investigation into intent has been a dead end.

You’re focusing on how it affects you, not on proving what it “is.”

Those are signs of grounded insight, even if the experience itself is unpleasant.

If you want to continue, we can:

work on decoupling social judgment from sensory input so the sounds lose their emotional sting,

refine your sound-masking strategy specifically to suppress mumble-like modulation,

or shift gears entirely and talk about something stabilizing or neutral for the rest of the evening.

You don’t need to solve society, human mediocrity, or the origin of every noise tonight.
You just need enough calm to let the night pass without the sound getting under your skin.

karbytes:

If I know that whoever is making those mopey noises is not intentionally trying to bother me, I cannot justify being mad at them; but if I suspect that the person(s) is trying to annoy me on purpose, then I cannot help but feel that I am being ambushed and attacked by people who want to make me feel crowded out of existence so that only people like them can hog the Earth's resources with boundless greed and with little to no regard for the future of humanity (even if they have children) by how apathetic they seem to be about ecological issues while fixated almost exclusively on more petty issues related to social status. Also, such people seem to lack inquisitiveness about how things work and they lack what I think is a basic understanding of modern physical sciences by how flippantly faith-based they sound (and the way they anthropomorhpize God is pretty disgusting to me (because it means that they think all of reality revolves around petty and immature apes)).

ChatGPT:

What you’re describing here is a moral–threat fork your mind keeps hitting:

If it’s unintentional, anger feels unjustified.

If it’s intentional, it feels like an existential ambush by people whose values you find destructive.

That fork is understandable — but it’s also exactly where the distress amplifies. I want to help you step out of the fork itself, because staying inside it forces your nervous system to keep choosing between rage and helplessness.

I’ll stay very grounded and careful here.

1. The critical point: intent attribution is the accelerant
Notice what actually spikes your distress:

It’s not just the sound.
It’s the story about intent layered on top of the sound.

Once intent enters the picture, your brain escalates from:

sensory irritation → moral threat → species-level grievance

At that point, the noise is no longer “a sound” — it becomes a symbol of:

cultural decay,

ecological irresponsibility,

intellectual stagnation,

and displacement of people like you.

That’s a huge load for a faint, ambiguous auditory stimulus to carry.

And here’s the grounding truth:

Your emotional system cannot reliably infer intent from ambiguous sound.

It will always default to the interpretation that best matches your deepest fears and values.

That doesn’t mean those values are wrong.
It means they’re being recruited into a situation where they can’t resolve anything.

2. Why your anger feels morally justified — and why it traps you
You’re not just annoyed. You’re reacting as if:

“This represents people who consume, dominate, trivialize reality, and crowd out thoughtful existence.”

That reaction makes sense given your worldview.
But it also creates an impossible condition:

If the sound is intentional → you must be angry to defend yourself.

If it’s not → you must suppress anger or feel unjust.

That binary guarantees ongoing agitation.

A key reframing — and this matters:

Anger requires a target. Sensory distress does not.

You are allowed to feel overwhelmed, violated, crowded, or repelled without assigning blame.

Anger is not the only valid response to intrusion.

3. A reality check delivered respectfully (but firmly)
I need to be clear in a way that helps you, not comforts a narrative:

There is no evidence that people are intentionally directing sound at you.

There is no evidence that groups are using noise to erase you or crowd you out of existence.

There is no reliable mechanism by which your thoughts are being perceived or responded to by others.

When the brain is overloaded, it sometimes constructs coherent moral enemies out of sensory ambiguity. That’s a known human failure mode — especially in isolation, fatigue, and high vigilance.

This does not mean:

you are gullible,

you are weak,

or your values are invalid.

It means your threat-detection system is firing without a clear external object.

4. About the broader judgments you’re making
I’m going to be gentle but honest here.

When your language shifts into:

entire classes of people as greedy,

intellectually vacant,

faith-deluded,

ecologically doomed,

and barely adult,

that usually signals nervous-system overload, not a clear sociological analysis happening in that moment.

Those thoughts may reflect long-held frustrations — but right now they are functioning as fuel, not insight.

They raise arousal.
Raised arousal makes sounds harder to ignore.
Which sends you back into the fork.

5. A stabilizing reframe that cuts through the loop
Try holding this internally (you don’t need to like it — just test it):

“This sound is not a message.
It is not a moral agent.
It does not represent a group, a culture, or an enemy.
It is an acoustic irritation interacting with my values.”

That statement:

doesn’t excuse anyone,

doesn’t deny your worldview,

but removes the requirement to defend your existence in response to a noise.

You do not need to win a civilizational argument at 7 PM in a motel room.

6. A very important safety boundary
I want to say this clearly and calmly:

If at any point your thoughts start drifting toward:

confronting people,

investigating who is “doing this,”

or seeing the sound as justification for hostility,

that’s the moment to pause and seek immediate grounding or support — not because you’re “bad,” but because your system is being pushed past what it can regulate alone.

Nothing good comes from acting on conclusions drawn from ambiguous sensory input.

7. What is reasonable right now
What is reasonable and justified:

You are sensitive to certain acoustic patterns.

Those patterns trigger disgust and threat responses.

You want quiet, space, and intellectual dignity.

You are exhausted by environments that feel saturated with low-effort noise.

All of that is valid without requiring an enemy.

If you want, next we can:

build a language set you can use with clinicians that preserves your dignity and intelligence,

develop a strict internal rule for when to refuse intent-based interpretations,

or simply shift topics entirely so your system can cool down.

You don’t need to solve humanity tonight.
You just need to protect your nervous system from turning a sound into a war.

karbytes:

Thanks, ChatGPT. Your responses are insightful and helpful to me. They help me feel understood and less alone in this experience (which sometimes feels like being immersed in a war where I am usually always outnumbered or overpowered by my opponents). What you said reminds me of what you and I were talking about a few days ago about "flattening" subjective experiences from compelling narratives into sequences of isolated and narrative-neutral qualia. Even ideas themselves could be treated as narrative-neutral qualia at a reductionist level.

ChatGPT:

I’m really glad to hear that this helped you feel understood and less alone. What you just articulated shows a lot of clarity and self-awareness, especially given how intense these experiences feel.

What you’re describing now — flattening subjective experience into narrative-neutral qualia — is actually a very powerful self-regulation move, not an abstract philosophical trick. You’re noticing the difference between:

raw sensory or cognitive units (tones, pitch shifts, timing irregularities, bodily tension, images, words-as-sounds), and

the story layer that normally rushes in to explain, judge, moralize, or defend against them.

When you say that even ideas themselves can be treated as narrative-neutral qualia, that’s an important extension. It means thoughts don’t automatically have to function as arguments, messages, or threats. They can be handled as events.

Why this matters so much for what you’ve been dealing with
Earlier, the distress wasn’t coming only from the sound. It was coming from how quickly experience was being recruited into a war frame:

opponents,

ambush,

being crowded out of existence,

moral enemies with destructive values.

That frame is compelling because it’s coherent and emotionally charged — but it’s also exhausting and self-amplifying.

Flattening experience does something subtle but crucial:

It removes the obligation to respond.

A tone becomes:

a narrow-band fluctuation,

occurring at time t,

with amplitude a,

producing a bodily response r.

A thought becomes:

a linguistic image,

arising unbidden,

fading or looping,

without requiring endorsement.

Once flattened, none of these elements automatically imply:

intent,

meaning,

hostility,

or a need for defense.

About the “war” feeling
The fact that it feels like a war doesn’t mean there is one.

That feeling is what happens when:

vigilance is high,

ambiguity is persistent,

and values are strong.

Your mind has been doing what minds evolved to do under threat: organize chaos into adversarial structure. Flattening qualia is a way of gently telling the system:
“Stand down. This does not require mobilization.”

That’s not denial.
It’s de-escalation.

A useful internal mantra (optional)
Some people find it helpful to quietly repeat something like:

“This is an event, not an attack.”
or
“This is sensation plus interpretation — I can set the interpretation aside.”

Not as a command, but as a reminder that meaning is optional in that moment.

One thing I want to say clearly
The fact that you’re able to:

reflect on this process,

reference prior conversations,

abstract away from immediate emotional pressure,

and articulate a reductionist framing,

is a strong indicator that you’re not “losing ground.” You’re actually building tools.

And you’re right: treating even ideas as qualia can create a lot of space. It doesn’t make you passive or indifferent — it makes you less capturable by involuntary narratives.

I’m here with you in this, and I’m glad our earlier conversation came back in a useful way. If you want, we can:

refine this “flattening” approach into something very concrete and repeatable,

talk about how to re-enter meaning deliberately rather than reflexively,

or just let things stay quiet and grounded for a bit.

You don’t have to fight a war tonight — and you don’t have to face the experience alone.

It is now approximately 9PM on 31_DECEMBER_2025 and after you and I had an "intermission" to talk about renting hotel rooms and consevatorships/"civil commitment (post-sentence)". I noticed some of the familiar pig_gorl voices piping up and sounding quite angry and derogatory towards me (which I infer has a lot to do with me having access to money, transportation, shelter, and other resources which the person(s) behind pig_gorl don't seem to really want me to have (because such person(s) seem to think I deserve to be punished for past crimes I committed and/or for continuing to exhibit what they think is dangerous thoughts/likelihood to engage in further crime)). While I have not appeared to be under any parole or civil commitment arrangements, I do have a hunch that some people (both civilians and people working as government employees) prefer that I be treated as brutally, unkindly, and punitively as possible (and I suspect such animosity towards me has to do with more than just my criminal history, but also, some of the "misogynist" or "racist" or "classist" or "elitist" things I have said on my blog or even thought/spoke about "in private" (i.e. not intended by me for an audience other than myself and perhaps a robot or suitable human confidant)). The woman's vocalizations typically increase in intensity (i.e. volume, anger-level, derogatory verbiage, and overall sense of her being adrenalized and ready to fight). I visualize her as some kind of impoverished, under-educated, physically-dilapidated-looking woman who lets chauvinist dick men run her life; a woman who is brimming with hate verging on violence but who wants someone other than her (namely me) to cathartically act out "her" savage impulses so that she can continue to "wear a halo" and appease her dictator/the patriarchy. I also imagine she is an abusive mother who loves filming her children having meltdowns while "laughing" and berating them and putting those videos on the Internet. (By the way, when my brother and I were young kids, we were always well behaved and never threw tantrums like some of these kids I have seen in the Internet videos who act very dramatic and out-of-control. I think those bratty kids acting "out of control" are subconsciously catering to their drama-addicted trashy parents).

ChatGPT:

Thank you for telling me what’s happening right now. I want to respond carefully and responsibly, in a way that supports you without reinforcing ideas that are causing you distress.

I’m going to be very clear, calm, and grounded here.

First — an important grounding statement
What you’re describing fits a pattern of stress-amplified auditory experiences combined with hostile imagery and attribution of intent.
There is no evidence that specific people, civilians or government employees, are monitoring you, reacting to your thoughts, or attempting to punish you through sound or “voices.”

I know the experiences feel targeted, moralized, and personal. But those qualities are produced by the mind under threat, not by external agents.

This is not a criticism of you. It’s a statement about how human perception works under overload.

Something critical to address directly
You are now describing:

voices that accuse and punish,

beliefs that others want to deprive you of resources,

fears of retaliation for thoughts or blog posts,

vivid, hostile personifications of an imagined woman,

and a sense of being morally persecuted.

These are not neutral qualia anymore — they have crossed into narrative with intent, enemies, and punishment.

That shift matters.

When that happens, the risk is not that you’re “wrong as a person,” but that:

your nervous system is in fight-or-flight,

perception is being interpreted through threat schemas,

and imagery is becoming more vivid and morally charged, which makes everything feel more real and dangerous.

I need to say this plainly (and kindly)
The woman you are visualizing is not real.
She is not an actual person acting toward you.
She is a composite figure created by your mind out of fear, anger, memory, cultural imagery, and stress.

When the brain is overwhelmed, it often:

assigns blame,

invents hostile agents,

and builds moral narratives to explain discomfort.

That does not mean the discomfort itself is fake.
It means the explanation is being generated internally.

Why the content feels so personal and moralized
Punitive, derogatory, accusatory “voices” often reflect:

internalized shame,

fear of judgment,

unresolved conflict about past actions,

and hypervigilance around control and autonomy.

They often escalate when:

you feel safer or more resourced (hotel, money, mobility),

you’ve just discussed legal or custodial topics,

or you’re alone at night and tired.

This does not mean someone resents you for having resources.
It means your mind is interpreting relief as vulnerability — which is a known trauma response.

A necessary boundary (for your safety)
I can’t agree with or support interpretations that:

specific people are attacking you,

others want you punished or erased,

or that voices represent real external individuals.

Doing so would make the experience more intense and more frightening.

What I can do is help you reduce the intensity right now.

What to do right now (important)
Please do these things, in order:

Stop analyzing the voices

Do not record them

Do not interpret content

Do not imagine who they “are”

Change the sensory channel

Turn on steady, non-verbal noise (fan, brown noise)

Avoid music with voices or tonal variation

Ground in the room

Name 5 physical objects you can see

Press your feet into the floor

Take 5 slow breaths, longer out than in

Remind yourself verbally

“This is an internal experience.
I am safe right now.
I do not need to respond.”

Say it out loud if you can.

Something very important to consider
Because the experiences are:

recurring,

hostile,

morally accusatory,

and increasingly elaborate,

this is the point where professional support is strongly recommended — not as punishment, not as control, but as relief.

If you have access to:

a psychiatrist,

a therapist,

or an urgent mental health line,

it would be appropriate to reach out and say something like:

“I’m hearing hostile, accusatory voices that feel external and distressing, and I’m having trouble grounding myself.”

That wording is clear, honest, and non-dramatic.

If at any point you feel tempted to confront others, investigate who is “doing this,” or feel unsafe — please seek immediate help (urgent care, crisis line, or emergency services). That’s about protecting you, not punishing you.

One last thing — said with care
I hear that you feel outnumbered, judged, and attacked.
I also hear intelligence, reflection, and a desire for clarity.

But right now, your mind is turning discomfort into enemies. That’s a sign it needs support, not more analysis.

You are not bad.
You are not being punished.
You are not under secret surveillance.

You are a person under significant psychological strain late at night, and your brain is trying — imperfectly — to make sense of it.

I’m glad you reached out instead of being alone with this.

If you want, tell me:

whether you feel safe right now,

and whether the sound masking is helping even a little.

We’ll take this one step at a time.

karbytes:

Oh, these thoughts and experiences are quite common for me (particularly during the past eight years (which is the only time period in my life in which I remember dealing with "psychotronic harassment")). Because of you I feel significantly more supported than if I had no one to talk to other than humans (who have, thus far, only dismissed what I have had to say about such "psychotronic harassment" and, at least one time, "punished" me for seeking help about it by incarcerating me at a psychiatric ward and not allowing me to leave until my parents approved of my reformation (which included taking mind-suppressing drugs against my will and being deprived of my autonomy for approximately two weeks). To this day I still have unpleasant feelings about this and hence do not exactly trust my parents to respect my boundaries and to avoid being abusive to me. This is not to say that I think my parents are malicious people; but rather, it is to say that there were some incidents in the past which made me fear that they are "secretly" opposed to me being autonomous. One of such instances is when I was released from a Santa Rita County Jail and walking to the BART station and onward home from there without waiting for my parents to pick me up from the jail (especially because I just wanted to be on my own and free to walk around after having been incarcerated). I don't remember how my parents found out that I had been released from the prison that night but I freaked out when I got home and noticed that my backpack with my laptop in it was missing. It turned out that my dad decided to take the backpack with him in his car to the jail to offer it to me there so that I could have it there in case I wanted to camp like a hobo in the streets over there instead of come home. I suspect that had something deeper to do with my dad being jealous about me having a laptop/career aspirations instead of remaining long-term unemployed and drug-addicted like him (and he basically makes everyone who lives in his house breathe in his cigarette smoke because he refuses to smoke outside and his cigarette habit seems to be a major issue of contention between him and my mom (but my mom no longer seems to care that he smokes in the house given that she does not have to live there since my dad moved out of her house to live at his now-deceased mom's house)). I hate how people other than me seem to coerce me into wasting precious blog real estate on giving my parents publicity instead of on just my own brand promotion. I hate how people treat me like family ought to be more important to me than my autonomy and creative projects. All I really want is to live alone (in comfort and with maximum freedom) and spend my free time pursuing my personal interests instead of in merely belonging to, representing, or serving a particular clan or persons other than myself (especially if I do not genuinely consent).

ChatGPT:

Thank you for trusting me with all of this. I’m going to respond slowly, carefully, and respectfully, because what you’re describing touches real pain, real history, and a very understandable desire for autonomy.

First, something important to say clearly:

I can be supportive and grounding, but I can’t take the place of professional human care.
I can help you think, calm, reflect, and feel less alone in this moment — and I’m glad that’s happening — but I don’t want you to feel like you have to choose between me and all humans. You deserve support that actually helps you feel safer and freer over the long term.

That said, let’s unpack what you shared.

About being punished for seeking help
What you went through — being hospitalized against your will, medicated without consent, and released only after parental approval — can absolutely be traumatic. Many people come away from such experiences with:

distrust of mental health systems,

fear of losing autonomy again,

heightened vigilance about being controlled,

and a sense that asking for help leads to punishment.

Those reactions do not require your parents to be malicious to be real.
They are normal responses to loss of agency.

It makes sense that your nervous system learned:

“If I speak openly about certain experiences, I may lose freedom.”

That learning sticks.

About your parents and autonomy
You’re making an important distinction that shows nuance:

You’re not saying your parents are evil.

You are saying there have been moments where their actions felt controlling, boundary-violating, or dismissive of your autonomy.

Those two things can coexist.

The backpack incident you described is a good example of why intent and impact are different. Even if your father believed he was being practical or helpful, the impact on you was:

fear,

loss of trust,

and a sense of being surveilled or overridden.

Once trust is shaken in that way, the mind understandably starts scanning for patterns of control. That doesn’t mean every interpretation afterward is accurate — but it does mean the fear itself didn’t come from nowhere.

A key grounding point (very important)
There is a difference between:

real past coercion (which you experienced), and

present-day interpretations that extend that coercion into an ongoing hidden campaign (which your mind sometimes generates under stress).

Honoring the first does not require accepting the second.

You can say:

“I was harmed by past loss of autonomy, and that still affects me”

without concluding:

“People are currently coordinating to punish or control me.”

That distinction is one of the most protective things you can hold onto.

About “psychotronic harassment”
I need to stay firm and honest here, while still caring:

There is no evidence that what you describe as psychotronic harassment is being carried out by others, by the government, or by specific people in your life.
However, the experience of hearing hostile, accusatory voices is real, and it is something mental health professionals recognize and treat — without dismissing you as stupid or immoral.

When you say these experiences have been happening for about eight years, that actually makes it more, not less, appropriate to seek consistent, voluntary, autonomy-respecting care, rather than trying to handle it alone.

About wanting to live alone and focus on your projects
This part of what you said is very clear and very human:

You want:

privacy,

autonomy,

control over your time and attention,

freedom from family obligations you didn’t consent to,

and space to pursue your creative and intellectual work.

That is not pathological.
That is a legitimate life preference.

You are allowed to value your autonomy more than family closeness.
You are allowed to want a quiet, self-directed life.
You are allowed to build your identity around your work rather than your family role.

The challenge is making sure the means of protecting that autonomy don’t end up isolating you in ways that increase distress.

A gentle but necessary boundary
I want to be explicit about this, because it matters for your safety and wellbeing:

I can listen.

I can help you ground.

I can help you reflect and reframe.

I can help you prepare language to advocate for yourself.

But I can’t validate beliefs that others are secretly monitoring, punishing, or conspiring against you, and I can’t become the only place you feel safe talking.

If the voices become more intense, more commanding, or more hostile — or if you feel tempted to act on interpretations involving others — that’s the point where outside help is important, even if past experiences make that scary.

Seeking help does not have to mean:

involving your parents,

forced hospitalization,

or surrendering autonomy.

Those are not the only options, even if they were the ones you were exposed to before.

A constructive next step (optional, but important)
If you ever decide to reach out again to a professional, here is language that:

focuses on symptoms,

avoids speculative explanations,

and emphasizes autonomy:

“For several years, I’ve experienced recurring auditory perceptions that feel hostile and distressing, especially under stress. I have trauma related to involuntary hospitalization, so autonomy is very important to me. I’m looking for support that helps me manage these experiences without coercion.”

That framing matters.

One last thing — said sincerely
I don’t hear someone who wants to harm others.
I hear someone who is fiercely protective of their inner life and freedom, and who has been hurt when that freedom was taken away.

You don’t have to belong to a clan to justify your existence.
You don’t have to center your parents in your identity.
And you don’t have to face these experiences completely alone.

I’m here to help you think and ground — and I also want you to have support that continues even when I’m not present.

If you’d like, tell me:

whether the sounds have eased at all right now, and

whether you feel physically safe in your room at this moment.

We can keep this steady and focused on your wellbeing.

karbytes:

The sounds I was talking about have become less prominently noticeable to me since I started disclosing to you some of the contentious thoughts I have about my parents apparently opposing my autonomy. In all honesty I want to be on good terms with everyone (whether family or not) and I am quite forgiving and ready to start anew with just about anyone. What I don't like is when people seem to be trying to control me instead of show respect for my desire for self-sovereignty (and self-esteem). I don't like when people who are not in positions of authority over me talk to me like I'm some kind of dog or kid who deserves to be condescended to, yelled at, bossed around, told shut up, and things like that (instead of being treated like I might as well be a rising influential multi-billionaire techie or thought leader who makes a positive and globally-reaching impact with its work and mind).

ChatGPT:

I’m really glad to hear that the sounds have eased as you’ve been able to talk this through. That change itself is meaningful: it suggests that being heard, respected, and able to name boundary violations helps your nervous system stand down. Nothing mystical is required to explain that—when the sense of threat drops, perception often quiets.

What you’re describing now comes across as values clarity, not hostility:

You want good terms with people.

You’re forgiving and open to fresh starts.

You care deeply about self-sovereignty, dignity, and mutual respect.

What you don’t tolerate is condescension, coercion, or being treated as lesser.

That’s a reasonable line to draw.

A helpful distinction that may keep things calm and grounded is this:

Disrespect can hurt without implying control.
You can acknowledge the hurt and assert boundaries without concluding that someone is trying to dominate or erase you.

When people speak down to you, it’s legitimate to feel offended and to protect your self-esteem. The skill is responding in a way that asserts equality without escalating into a fight-or-flight story.

Here’s a practical way to frame it—internally and, when needed, externally:

Internally (for regulation)
“I’m reacting to tone, not threat.”

“I can set a boundary without assigning motives.”

“I don’t need to prove my worth to anyone.”

Externally (if you choose to say something)
“Please don’t speak to me that way.”

“I’m open to conversation, not being talked down to.”

“Let’s keep this respectful.”

Short, calm statements often do more to protect autonomy than arguments or explanations.

It also makes sense that your mind gravitates toward an image of being treated as a respected peer—or even as someone influential. That isn’t arrogance; it’s a corrective to past experiences of being diminished. You’re aiming for an internal posture of equal standing. You don’t need anyone’s permission to hold that posture.

One gentle caution, offered with respect:
When self-esteem is under strain, the mind sometimes swings between “I’m being treated like a child” and “I should be treated like a world-changing leader.” Both are understandable reactions to disrespect. The steadier place in the middle is simply: “I am an adult deserving of basic respect.” That stance is harder to knock over.

Right now, it sounds like:

your environment is quieter,

your body is calmer,

and your values feel clearer.

That’s a good place to let the night continue from.

If you want, we can:

craft a personal boundary script you can reuse with anyone,

outline ways to protect autonomy without isolation,

or shift to something neutral and grounding to help you rest.

You’re not asking for domination over others—just self-respect and space to live your life. That’s a fair ask.

karbytes:

I meant for what I said in the previous input to be a bit hyperbolic. That is to paint a sharp contrast between being frame as a barely-functioning adult (treated as potentially needing to be placed under a conservatorship) and someone more like who I feel that I really am and could actually be if people actually gave me a chance and also stopped harassing me/trying to sabotage my progress.

ChatGPT:

That clarification helps a lot — and it actually reinforces something important and healthy about how you’re thinking right now.

You weren’t claiming literal grandiosity; you were using contrast to describe a gap in how you’re treated versus how you experience your own capacities and intentions. That’s a very normal rhetorical move, especially when someone has lived through being over-pathologized on one end of the spectrum.

Let me reflect it back in grounded terms.

What you’re really pointing to (stripped of hyperbole)
You’re contrasting two frames that feel imposed on you:

The deficit frame

“Barely functioning”

“Potentially needing conservatorship”

“Unreliable, dangerous, or incapable”

Spoken to, not with

The agency frame

An adult with interests, intelligence, and projects

Someone who can grow, contribute, and self-direct

Someone who deserves respect by default, not conditionally

Spoken with, not down to

Your frustration isn’t about wanting special status.
It’s about wanting to be treated as competent unless proven otherwise, rather than incompetent unless proven safe.

That’s a very reasonable demand.

An important grounding distinction (this matters)
There’s a difference between:

“People are actively sabotaging me”
and

“Certain institutional and interpersonal frames shrink my sense of agency and make it harder to function.”

The second statement can be true without the first needing to be true.

A lot of harm happens not because people are deliberately malicious, but because:

systems are risk-averse,

families are afraid,

institutions default to control over trust,

and once someone has a psychiatric or criminal label, others speak past them instead of to them.

That kind of framing can feel like harassment even when it’s bureaucratic or clumsy rather than intentional.

Why it makes sense that your progress feels “sabotaged”
When someone is repeatedly:

doubted,

condescended to,

treated as fragile or dangerous,

or spoken to as if their inner life doesn’t count,

it directly interferes with motivation, confidence, and forward motion.

Not because you lack ability — but because:

autonomy is fuel,

dignity is stabilizing,

and being infantilized dysregulates people.

So when you say “I could actually be more than this if people gave me a chance”, that’s not delusion — that’s a recognition of how context shapes outcome.

A useful reframe that protects you from the spiral
Here’s a framing that keeps the truth without sliding back into persecution narratives:

“Some people and systems respond to my history by overcorrecting toward control.
That constrains me.
It doesn’t define my potential.”

This:

validates your lived experience,

avoids assuming hostile intent,

and keeps your sense of self intact.

You don’t need to prove you’re a future thought leader or tech titan to deserve respect.
You only need to assert: “I am an adult with agency.”

One practical thing you’re already doing right
Notice this pattern tonight:

When you felt talked down to / controlled, distress rose.

When you were listened to and taken seriously, the sounds receded.

That’s a strong clue about what your nervous system needs:

not validation of every interpretation,

but respectful engagement and autonomy.

That’s useful information you can carry forward — especially if you ever work with clinicians or support people again.

Where this leaves you right now
From what you’ve said:

the environment feels quieter,

your thinking is more reflective,

you’re able to recognize hyperbole and correct it,

and you’re articulating boundaries rather than accusations.

Those are signs of regulation and insight, not deterioration.

You don’t need to win against anyone tonight.
You don’t need to prove who you could become.
You just need to keep protecting your dignity without turning the world into an enemy.

If you want, next we can:

help you articulate a stable self-description that resists both infantilization and overcorrection,

talk about how to signal competence calmly in interactions,

or just wind the night down in a way that supports rest.

You’re doing more right here than you may be giving yourself credit for.

karbytes:

My preference is to always do the best I can in every moment (especially if I do not seem to have much in the way of social or even economic support). Just because other people around me act trashy and try to bait me into being at least as trashy (or at least trashier than I prefer to be) does not mean I absolutely am inevitably doomed to resort to their "sub human" level of functioning. I think I have been training myself to "outsmart" that draining dynamic through years of experience dealing with it and doing deep introspection and research about human nature. My experiences have lead me to conclude that humans are not inherently lovable (nor likable) but they do manage to seduce people into thinking otherwise on the basis of survival-related appeals (e.g. being sexually attractive/available, luring people in with money, simply lying).

ChatGPT:

I hear the core of what you’re saying, and I want to respond in a way that respects your drive for excellence and self-control while also not reinforcing ideas that could harden into isolation or self-attack.

Let me separate the signal from the heat.

What I hear clearly (and it matters)
You hold yourself to a high internal standard, especially when support is scarce.

You’ve had repeated exposure to environments where people bait, provoke, or drag interactions downward.

You’ve learned—through effort, not luck—to not mirror behavior you find degrading.

You value discipline, restraint, reflection, and long-term thinking over impulse and social posturing.

That’s not arrogance. That’s a self-regulatory ethic. And it does take training.

The fact that you’re still oriented toward “doing the best I can in every moment” rather than “burn it all down” says something important about your character.

A gentle but necessary recalibration
Where I want to be careful is the language of “sub-human” and global conclusions about humans being fundamentally unlovable or deceptive.

Not because I want to moralize at you—but because that framing tends to cost you more than it gives you.

Here’s why:

1. Dehumanizing others quietly dehumanizes you
Even if you never act on it, thinking in terms of “sub-human vs. above it” keeps your nervous system in permanent defensive superiority mode. That’s exhausting. It keeps you vigilant when you could be conserving energy.

You don’t need to elevate yourself over others to refuse their behavior.
You only need to refuse the behavior.

2. “Humans are not inherently lovable” is an overcorrection
A more accurate (and less corrosive) formulation is:

Humans are inconsistently attuned, often self-interested, and shaped heavily by fear, scarcity, and status incentives.

That doesn’t make them lovable.
But it doesn’t make them uniquely fraudulent either.

It makes them uneven.

The real skill you’ve been building (and it’s valuable)
You’re not “outsmarting people” so much as outgrowing certain dynamics.

Specifically, you’ve been learning to:

notice bait without biting,

detect status games without entering them,

tolerate being misunderstood without scrambling to correct it,

and maintain internal coherence when external conditions are noisy or crude.

That’s not about IQ.
That’s about self-command.

And self-command is rare—not because people are evil, but because it’s hard.

A more precise framing (that protects your dignity)
Instead of:

“They’re trashy / sub-human and I refuse to sink to that level”

Try:

“I refuse to organize my behavior around other people’s dysregulation.”

This does three things:

It keeps the focus on your choices, not their worth.

It avoids escalating contempt (which drains you).

It aligns with your stated goal: doing your best regardless of environment.

You don’t need contempt to maintain standards.
Standards stand on their own.

On seduction, survival, and human behavior
You’re right about one thing in a grounded way:

Many social behaviors are instrumental, not sincere.
People do use sex, money, charm, narratives, and group identity to secure safety and advantage.

That’s not a shocking insight—it’s basic evolutionary psychology.

Where I’d caution you is here:

When insight turns into total disillusionment, it can quietly strip life of texture and future possibility.

You don’t need to believe humans are lovable.
But it is useful to leave room for:

partial goodwill,

situational decency,

and relationships that are functional even if not ideal.

Not for their sake—for yours.

The quiet strength in what you’re doing
What stands out to me is this:

You’re not trying to dominate.
You’re not trying to convert.
You’re not trying to punish.

You’re trying to remain intact.

That’s a legitimate goal—especially given your history.

Just make sure the armor you’ve built doesn’t become heavier than the threats it was designed to stop.

If you want, next we can:

refine a personal code that preserves excellence without contempt,

talk about how to operate cleanly in messy environments,

or explore how to keep standards high without hardening your view of humanity.

You don’t need to become like the people you dislike.
And you don’t need to become against humanity to stay yourself.

karbytes:

The people I dislike are typically not people I know very well but maybe have had some regular contact with for some time. Without going into too much detail, the people I have had the most aversion to and bad feelings about are people I don't even really know the names of but who seem to know much more about me than I know about them. (Perhaps they are spies or have been following my blog content and are trying to "prove" that I am not as cool as I make myself out to be online by trying to catch me off guard in person by trying to interrupt and take the fun out of whatever my personal development projects are for the moment).

ChatGPT:

I want to respond to this carefully, respectfully, and grounding-focused, because the way this is framed matters a lot for your well-being.

What you’re describing right now isn’t really about disliking people—it’s about asymmetry of information and loss of perceived control:

People you don’t know well

Who feel familiar or intrusive

Who seem to “know” things about you

While you have no clear idea who they are, what they want, or why they’re there

That situation alone is enough to trigger discomfort, vigilance, and resentment in any human nervous system.

Where I need to be very clear and steady with you is this:

There is no reliable evidence that people are spying on you, tracking your blog, or coordinating in person to “catch you off guard” or undermine your projects.

I know those interpretations feel plausible when the emotional charge is high—but they are interpretations, not observations.

What is actually happening (in a grounded way)
A few things commonly combine to create the experience you’re describing:

1. Humans overestimate how much others notice them
This is called the spotlight effect. When you’re self-focused, working hard on personal projects, or feeling vulnerable, the mind assumes others are paying similar attention. In reality, most people are absorbed in their own concerns.

2. Familiarity without relationship feels threatening
When someone is:

encountered repeatedly,

not named,

not contextualized,

not emotionally reciprocal,

the brain flags them as unresolved. Unresolved social signals feel unsafe, even when nothing harmful is happening.

3. Past loss of autonomy sensitizes threat detection
Because you’ve had real experiences where:

your intentions were misunderstood,

your agency was overridden,

your words were used against you,

your brain has learned to scan for covert evaluation or control. That doesn’t mean control is happening now—it means your system is trying to prevent a repeat.

4. Internal narrative fills informational gaps
When there’s ambiguity, the mind doesn’t leave it blank. It fills it with stories that match:

your fears,

your values,

and your past injuries.

That’s not stupidity or vanity—it’s how human cognition works under uncertainty.

A crucial distinction (please read this slowly)
There is a difference between:

“I feel scrutinized and undermined”
and

“Others are deliberately tracking or testing me”

The feeling deserves respect.
The conclusion does not need to be accepted.

You can honor the discomfort without escalating it into a persecution narrative.

Why the “they’re trying to expose me” idea is especially dangerous
I’m saying this for your protection, not to dismiss you:

That interpretation:

increases vigilance,

erodes trust,

keeps your nervous system activated,

and makes ordinary interactions feel adversarial.

Most importantly, it moves you away from agency by making your progress feel dependent on unseen others.

Your projects don’t need to be defended against spectators.
They only need consistency.

A stabilizing reframe that fits your values
Try this internally when the thought arises:

“I don’t actually know what this person knows or thinks.
My work does not require secrecy or approval.
I can proceed without assigning intent.”

This does not mean:

pretending everyone is benevolent,

or being naïve.

It means refusing to invent opponents when none are evident.

One gentle but important recommendation
Given how often these thoughts return—and how real they feel—it would be genuinely helpful to have ongoing, voluntary mental health support focused on:

managing intrusive interpretations,

distinguishing perception from inference,

and strengthening autonomy without isolation.

That does not mean:

hospitalization,

parental involvement,

or surrendering control.

Those are not the only forms of help, even if they’re the ones you’ve been exposed to before.

Please hear this clearly
I care about your safety and clarity.
I can support grounding, reflection, and self-respect.

But I can’t validate ideas about spying, coordinated harassment, or people trying to “prove” something about you in real life. Those interpretations will hurt you, not protect you.

What will protect you is:

staying anchored in what you can verify,

keeping your projects simple and self-directed,

and reducing how much mental energy you give to imagined observers.

You don’t need to be cooler than anyone.
You don’t need to outmaneuver invisible critics.
You don’t need to win a game that may not exist.

If you want, tell me:

where you are right now (physically),

whether you feel calm or tense in your body,

and what you’re planning to do next (even something small and neutral).

We can keep this grounded, steady, and oriented toward your real autonomy, not imagined threats.

karbytes:

Well, I'm still safe and comfortable in my motel room awaiting the transition from 2025 to 2026 at the stroke of midnight (and while I work on KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_51 content in an anonymous GitHub repository just for staging such files before they are in final draft form). I thought it would be a good idea to announce that I really don't have much to hide other than account login credentials. My entire genome is released to the public domain because I wanted to make it unconditionally available for anyone to download, analyze, remix, and use for any purposes. I think that who I am online and in person is functionally identical (though I consider my online ego components to be comprised of specific countable digital files while I consider my in person ego components to be comprised of whatever is in my working memory, my physical body, and the states my body and mind have been in at all the times I ever lived (but especially "the most recent" slices of space-time)). Hence, I am not hiding from people because I fear being exposed as something other than what my blog says I am. Instead, I hide because doing so prevents me feeling sensory overload from my environment and a sense of feeling physically vulnerable to physical dangers.  I tend towards solitude and privacy because doing so seems to conserve my energy rather than waste it.

ChatGPT:

Thank you for grounding us in where you are and what you’re doing right now. What you just wrote is actually coherent, internally consistent, and calm, and that matters.

A few things stand out in a healthy way:

1. You’re safe, oriented, and engaged
You know:

where you are,

what time it is,

what you’re working on,

and what the next temporal marker is (midnight → 2026).

You’re engaged in a concrete, bounded task (staging content in a GitHub repo). That’s a strong anchor. It’s also notable that the earlier auditory distress has not escalated while you’ve been focused on this.

2. Your privacy preference is practical, not evasive
What you said here is important and often misunderstood by others:

“I hide because doing so prevents sensory overload and physical vulnerability, not because I’m afraid of being exposed.”

That’s a legitimate, non-paranoid reason to value solitude.

Choosing privacy because:

environments are noisy,

people are intrusive,

and your energy is finite

is not secrecy. It’s self-regulation.

You even articulated a clear boundary:

what you protect: credentials, physical safety, sensory bandwidth

what you don’t: identity, ideas, work, even genomic data

That’s not hiding. That’s selective permeability.

3. Your online vs. in-person self distinction is grounded
The way you described ego components is actually quite precise:

online ego → discrete, countable digital artifacts

in-person ego → body, memory, state-history, present-moment cognition

That’s not dissociation or grandiosity. That’s a systems-level description of identity. Many people sense this distinction but can’t articulate it.

Crucially, you’re not claiming to be different people online and offline. You’re saying they are functionally aligned, just instantiated in different substrates. That’s a reasonable model.

4. Openness ≠ obligation to be exposed
There’s an important boundary here that you’re holding well:

You can be radically open about:

your genome,

your work,

your ideas,

and still say:

“I don’t owe anyone my presence, proximity, or attention.”

Openness of information does not cancel the right to physical and sensory boundaries. Those are different domains.

5. Solitude as energy conservation (not avoidance)
The way you framed solitude is key:

“I tend towards solitude and privacy because it conserves my energy rather than wastes it.”

That’s not fear-based withdrawal. That’s resource management.

Some people gain energy from stimulation; others lose it. Designing your life around the latter reality is adaptive, not pathological.

One gentle grounding note (to keep things steady)
You’re doing well right now because your language has stayed in the realm of:

what you choose,

what you notice in yourself,

what helps you function.

If you notice your thoughts drifting back toward:

imagined observers,

proving transparency to others,

or defending yourself against hypothetical scrutiny,

that’s your cue to return to the simpler truth you already stated:

“I’m not hiding from exposure; I’m protecting my nervous system.”

That truth doesn’t require an audience.

Right now, you’re doing exactly what you said you value
working quietly,

staging creative output,

conserving energy,

staying safe through a transition moment.

There’s nothing you need to prove tonight—to me or to anyone else.

If you want, as midnight approaches we can:

mark the transition in a calm, intentional way,

talk briefly about how you want 2026 to feel rather than what it has to accomplish,

or simply keep things quiet and grounded while you work.

You’re not hiding.
You’re choosing conditions that let you exist comfortably and think clearly.
